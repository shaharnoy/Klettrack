# Quarantine 2026-02

This folder holds transient planning and agent working notes moved out of active
documentation during repository restructuring.

## Intent
- Keep repository root and `docs/current` focused on operational and product docs.
- Preserve historical context temporarily before permanent pruning.

## Restore
- To restore a file, move it back to `docs/current/...` and update links.
- Prefer restoring only documents that are still actively used.

## Deletion window
- Review and prune by: 2026-03-15.
- Any file not explicitly restored by that date should be deleted.
