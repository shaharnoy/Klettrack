# Klettrack

iOS app for planning, logging, and analyzing climbing and training.  
This is a **community-driven project**: created for climbers, shaped by feedback, and it will **always remain free**.

## ✨ Key Features
- Log your climbs by **style, gym, grade, angle, hold types, and colors**.  
- Board climber? **Sync your Kilter/Tension Board sends** in a click for complete tracking.  
- Plan **training cycles** with templated time blocks and a catalog of ~100 exercises.  
- Use the **integrated interval timer** with built-in protocols, rest/prep configuration, and hangboard support.  
- Track progress **over time** with analytics, filters, and charts.  
- **Privacy-first:** all data stays local on your device — nothing leaves your phone.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/klettrack.git
   cd klettrack
   ```
2. Open `ClimbingProgram.xcodeproj` in Xcode

## 🧩 Repository Components

This repository is a monorepo with three runtime components:

- iOS app: `ClimbingProgram` and `ClimbingProgram.xcodeproj`
- Web app: `app.html` with assets under `web`
- Supabase backend: `supabase/functions` and `supabase/migrations`

* **TimerTests & TimerTemplateTests** – timer logic and calculations
* …and more (see `ClimbingProgramTests/`)

Run tests with:

```bash
Cmd+U  # inside Xcode
```
